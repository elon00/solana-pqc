# SCSTOBCMinority AI — Autonomous Reality-First Blueprint

## Mission

Turn this repository into a reproducible, evidence-driven Solana/AI project without treating simulations, documentation, placeholders, or local-only mocks as live integrations.

## Technology control matrix

The autonomous audit checks 18 capability areas:

1. Solana on-chain program
2. Anchor
3. PDA architecture
4. CPI
5. Token-2022
6. Multi-wallet
7. Wallet authentication
8. Solana Actions
9. Blinks
10. QR / Solana Pay
11. AI agents
12. Multi-model AI routing
13. MCP
14. x402
15. USDC payments
16. Post-quantum cryptography
17. Conway / cellular automata
18. Real-time WebSocket/event subscriptions

## Scientific integration rule

A technology is not considered complete because its name appears in a README. Completion requires appropriate evidence: executable source, tests, CI, and when applicable public-chain transaction/program evidence.

## One-click loop

Run **Actions → Autonomous One-Click Reality Check → Run workflow**.

The workflow:

- installs dependencies reproducibly;
- runs available lint/typecheck/test/build gates;
- scans code and configuration for the 18 technologies;
- produces `AUTONOMOUS_TECH_REPORT.json`;
- uploads the report as a workflow artifact.

## Autonomous upgrade order

1. Fix failing existing tests/build/security gates.
2. Remove or qualify unsupported claims.
3. Add missing core architecture only where it serves the product.
4. Add tests for each integration.
5. Add Devnet/Testnet evidence for network-dependent features.
6. Keep Mainnet fail-closed until independent review and explicit release approval.

## Truth boundary

- Source code != live deployment.
- Passing tests != independent audit.
- PQC application code != Solana L1 quantum resistance.
- x402 protocol code != a settled USDC transaction.
- Token mint scripts != a verified mint unless Explorer/RPC evidence exists.
- Internal scorecards/certificates are not external certifications.
